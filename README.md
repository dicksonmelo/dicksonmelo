### Hi there :alien:

As you can see, my name is Dickson Melo.

Country boy living in the big city, I'm currently developing a Store Website on my own. Despite a short time of study, I am already making great strides. News coming soon in my Github.

I'm currently studying a Javascript stack with NodeJS for backend and ReactJS for frontend. In between, I try to improve my English, read about machine learning and IT careers.

I seek to colaborate with big or small fullstack projects that envolves Javascript and cool things.

Games, rock'n'roll and technology lover.
